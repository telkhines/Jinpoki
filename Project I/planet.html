                        <p><u>Xaoc</u> is the home planet and origins of Jinpoki. The planet is surrounded by its moon cloud debris, has a breatheable atmosphere, and a slightly lighter gravity than that of Earth. Thousands of centuries ago, the Mother Jinpoki crashed on this almost ocean-wide planet that soon became home to her succeeding colonies. The inhabitants have built life around lush plant-life in these islands, and live off of a variety of alien fruits and fishes.</p>

                        <p>There are five notable zones, for further information, please see:</p>

                        <h2 id="Landing-Sites_anchor">Landing Sites</h2>
                        <p>The landing sites are airports for spaceships and planes of alien visitors or those permitted to leave the planet in order to visit the rest of the planets within the galaxy (or more).</p>

                        <h2 id="Xiudae_anchor">Xiudae</h2>

                            <p><u>Northern Xiudae</u> — can be considered an extension of the landing sites; handling all alien visitors and those wishing to leave the planet for a journey.</p>
                            <p><u>Central Xiudae</u> — is the usual living grounds for Jinpoki, having clean streets and fast living. Time here is taken up by busy jobs, the night life, the beach, and many other fun locations and activities; it's all down to the individual!</p>
                            <p><u>O</u> — the white circle in the center of the largest continent — is a marked location within central Xiudae, where the current queen lives and governs over the entirety of Xaoc. It is rumored that the cavern to the Mother Jinpoki's carcass can be found within this area.</p>
                            <p><u>Xahrein</u> — is a small but rough region to live in, found between the central and southern Xiudae. It's a much smaller city and has hands in shady dealings such as gambling and gangs. It's dubbed The Neon Nightmare because of it's gleaming, flickering lighting at night from the bars and casinos that scatter the place.</p>
                            <p><u>Southern Xiudae</u> — is similar to the Central, where life is just as busy but considerably slower. Most festivals and vacations are held and found in its varying resorts and tourist spots.</p>

                        <h2 id="HQ_anchor">HQ</h2>
                            <p>Also known as Head Quarters, is where Jinpoki's military base camps and weaponry are developed for the planet's protection.</p>

                        <h2 id="The-Swamp_anchor">The Swamp</h2>
                            <p>Past the crowds and neon lights of Xiudae, you'll come across the islands of The Swamp. A marshland of humble wooden huts and lodges belonging to simple living Jinpoki who wouldn't live any other way. These Jinpoki live to hunt. Leaders of The Swamp tribes don't take kindly to outsiders, but have hearts enough to help them if needed, only if they promise to keep their stays short.</p>

                            <p>Colloquially known as Little Blue, The Never is far past the reaches of modern civilization, home to few Jinpoki that are even more savage and parasitic compared to those not from the region. These Jinpoki go as far as as to commit cannibalistic acts on unsuspecting newcomers. Little Blue is a small mass of islands where the rarest of fruits are found, few venture from the cities or the swamp to come here.</p>
